## New Keyword

#### In JavaScript, the new keyword is used to create an instance of an object from a constructor function. Constructor functions are regular functions but are intended to be used with the new keyword to create objects.

#### In this example:

1. We define a constructor function Person which takes name and age parameters and assigns them to properties of the created object using this.
2. We create a new instance of the Person object using the new keyword and assign it to the variable person1.
3. We then access the properties of the person1 object using dot notation (person1.name, person1.age).

#### Without the new keyword, this inside the constructor function would refer to the global object (window in a browser environment), which is generally not what you want when creating new objects. The new keyword ensures that a new object is created and this refers to that newly created object within the constructor function.
