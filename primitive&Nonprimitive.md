# 1. Primitive and Non Primitive Data types:

## In JavaScript, primitive data types are simple data types that represent single values, while non-primitive data types are more complex and can hold multiple values or other data types. Here's a simplified explanation:

### Primitive Data Types:

1. Basic building blocks of JavaScript.
2. They store single values directly.

#### Examples: numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined.

### Non-primitive Data Types:

1.Made up of multiple primitive or non-primitive data types.
2.They are more complex and can store collections of data.

#### Examples: arrays, objects.

### Difference:

1. Primitive data types are like individual LEGO blocks, while non-primitive data types are like LEGO sets made up of multiple blocks.
2. Primitive data types are simple and directly store values, while non-primitive data types can store more complex data structures.

In this example, age, name, isStudent, x, and y are primitive data types, while numbers and person are non-primitive data types.
